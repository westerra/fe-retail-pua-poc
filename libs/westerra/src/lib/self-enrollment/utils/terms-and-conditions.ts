        <h5 class="">General Information about Westerra Digital: </h5>
        <p class="">Westerra Digital is an Internet account access service. You may access your Account by computer, using
          your Westerra username, password and Internet connection, at virtually any time, day or night, 7 days a week to
          (1) check account balances, (2) transfer money (3) check the history of your Account, (4) pay most bills with
          Westerra Digital Bill Payment Service and (5) obtain Westerra product and service information. However, Westerra
          Digital may occasionally be unavailable due to record updating or technical difficulties. </p>
        <p class="">Westerra may discontinue or restrict Westerra Digital transactions without notice. You may terminate
          this agreement at any time by giving the Credit Union written notice. Entering your password when you sign in to
          Westerra Digital means you have read, understood and agreed with the disclosure connected with this service. You
          agree to be bound by future changes in terms that will be provided electronically. Additionally, you agree to be
          bound by future changes in terms relating to fees and consumer liability, notice of which shall be given in
          writing by email, secure message in Westerra Digital, or mail at least twenty-one (21) days prior to
          implementation. You agree to review the disclosures that are provided each time you access Westerra Digital.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h5 class="">Equipment and Technical Requirements: </h5>
        <p class="">You understand that you must have Internet Access through an Internet Service Provider and Internet
          Browser Software to use Westerra Digital. For your protection, Westerra’s Internet server requires you to use a
          form-capable browser such as Google Chrome. When your browser communicates with our server, the application
          information form is encrypted for security while traveling over the Internet. You understand that Westerra does
          not make any warranties on equipment, hardware, software or Internet Service Provider service, or any part
          therein, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
          particular purpose. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h5 class="">Consumer Liability Disclosure: </h5>
        <p class="">If you inform us within two (2) business days after you learn of unauthorized access to your Account,
          you can lose no more than $50 from your Account due to such unauthorized access. Otherwise, if you fail to
          notify Westerra that your password has been compromised or your Account has been accessed without your
          authorization, you could lose all the money in your Account, plus your maximum overdraft line of credit. If you
          do NOT inform us within two (2) business days after you learn of the unauthorized access, and we can prove we
          could have stopped someone from using your account without your permission had you informed us, you could lose
          as much as $500 from your Account. </p>
        <p class="">By accessing Westerra Digital, you agree that it is your responsibility to safeguard your password in
          order to prevent unauthorized transactions and/or Account access. You also agree that Westerra may revoke
          Internet account access if unauthorized account access and/or transactions occur (1) as the apparent result of
          your negligence in safeguarding your password, (2) for any violation of the terms of use described herein, (3)
          for use of the system for illegal activities or (4) for any other use of the system that, in Westerra’s opinion
          presents an unreasonable risk of damage or loss to Westerra, its members or third parties. </p>
        <p class="">You agree to notify Westerra AT ONCE if you believe that your password has been lost or stolen or that
          your account has been accessed without your authorization. Utilize the following information to contact
          Westerra:</p>
        <p class="my-0">Westerra Credit Union</p>

        <p class="">The best way to minimize your possible loss is to immediately contact Westerra by telephone, although
          you may advise Westerra in person or in writing. </p>
        <p class="">Advise Westerra AT ONCE if your Account statement evidences any electronic fund transfer that you did
          not make or authorize. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the first statement that reflected the
          unauthorized transfer was mailed to you, you may not be reimbursed for the unauthorized transfer, provided we
          can prove that we could have stopped the unauthorized transfer had you informed us in the allotted time.
          Westerra reserves the right to extend the above time periods for good cause shown. </p>
      </div>

          Current fees are listed on the Service Charge and Fee Schedule located on the Resources – Disclosures &

        <p class="">If Westerra does not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount
          according to this disclosure statement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages not to exceed the
          amount of the transaction, except as otherwise provided by law. However, there are some exceptions. We will NOT
          be liable, if:</p>
        <p class="">(1) Through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer;
          (2) The terminal or computer was malfunctioning in a manner which you knew, or reasonably should have known,
          would adversely affect the completion of your transaction; or
          (3) Circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable
          precautions that we have taken.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h5 class="">Account Information:</h5>
        <p class="">We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transactions you make:

          (4) If you give us written permission.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h5 class="">Error Resolution Notice:</h5>
        <p class="">Immediately call or write us at the telephone number or address listed above if you think your
          statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or
          receipt. You may also email us at Email@WesterraCU.com or send a secure message through Digital Banking. We must
          hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error
          appeared. If you inform us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within
          ten (10) business days. </p>

          believe it is an error or why you need more information; and
          (3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.</p>
        <p class="">We will determine whether an error occurred within ten (10) business days after we hear from you and
          will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to forty-five (45) days to
          investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within ten (10)
          business days for the amount you think is in error so that you will have the use of the money during the time it
          takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not
          receive it within ten (10) business days, we may not credit your account.</p>
        <p class="">We will tell you the results within three (3) business days after completing our investigation. If we

      <h2 class="">Bill Pay</h2>
      <div class="">
        <p class="">The use of this Bill Pay Agreement (this “Agreement”) requires that you read and agree to the terms
          and conditions contained herein. This Agreement between you and Westerra Credit Union (“Credit Union,” “we,”
          “our,” or “us”) governs your use of the bill pay services (the “Services”). The Services allow you to make
          one-time or recurring payment to others from your account using the Credit Union’s Services contained within the
          digital or mobile banking portals (collectively, “Digital Banking”). The payment for each bill payment
          transaction requested will be debited from your account immediately upon submission of the bill payment request.
        </p>
        <p class="">When you use the Services, or authorize others to use them, you agree to the terms and conditions of
          this Agreement. <b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THE
            SERVICES.</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <ol type="1">
          <li><b>Use of Digital Bill Pay.</b>The Service permits you to send funds: (a) a person or entity to which you
            wish a payment to be directed or the entity from which you receive electronic bills (each person or entity, a
            “Payee”); (b) to other persons with accounts outside of the Credit Union; and (c) to your other accounts
            (persons described in (b) and (c), each a “Non-Biller Payee(s)”). </li>
          <li><b>Payment Scheduling.</b>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>To schedule a payment, you must select a date your payment will be debited (such date, the “Scheduled
                Payment Date”) for each Payee. This will determine the date for your Payee to receive the payment (the
                “Deliver By Date”). When scheduling such payments, you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that results
                in a “Deliver By Date” which is no later than the date reflected on your Payee statement for which the
                payment is due (the “Due Date”) unless the Due Date falls on a nonbusiness day. If the actual Due Date
                falls on a non-business day, you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that results in a Due Date which is
                at least two (2) business days before the actual Due Date. All Deliver by Dates must be prior to any late
                date or grace period permitted by the Payee. </li>
              <li>The necessary funds must be made available in the checking account from which bill payments will be
                debited (your “Payment Account”) on the Scheduled Payment Date.
              </li>
              <li>The earliest possible Deliver By Date for each Payee (typically four business days from the current date
                if the Payee is capable of receiving the payment electronically or up to ten business days if the Payee is
                not capable of receiving the payment electronically) will be designated within the Service when you are
                scheduling the payment. Therefore, the Service will not permit you to select a Deliver By Date prior to
                the earliest possible Deliver By Date designed for the Payee. If the Payee permits, for a fee, the Credit
                Union may also offer a rush payment option (typically one to three business days) which may be paid via
                check or electronic payment, if supported by a Payee. </li>
              <li>You may choose to schedule payments to recur in the same amount at regular weekly, every other week,
                every four weeks, monthly, twice monthly, semi-monthly, every three months, every six months, or annual
                intervals. When you create a new Payee in the Service, it may take two business days to set up the Payee
                to receive payments. You should schedule a payment to a new Payee at least fourteen business days before
                any payment Due Date, to allow the Service time to set up the Payee and verify information about your
                account with the Payee. </li>
              <li>For all subsequent payments, you agree to allow at least four to fourteen days between the Scheduled
                Payment Date and the payment Due Date.</li>
              <li>If the Digital Banking session during which you schedule a payment or transfer ends by 2:00 PM MT on a
                business day, the Service will be considered to have received it on that day. Otherwise, it will be
                considered received on the following business day. </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Prohibited Transactions.</b> You agree not to use or attempt to use the Service: (a) to engage in any
            illegal purpose or activity or to violate any applicable law, rule or regulation, (b) to breach any contract
            or agreement by which you are bound, (c) to engage in any internet or online gambling transaction, whether or
            not gambling is legal in any applicable jurisdiction, (d) to engage in any activity or business that would
            result in you being or becoming a “money service business” as defined in Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing
            regulations, or (e) to engage in any transaction or activity that is not specifically authorized and permitted
            by this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that the Credit Union has no obligation to monitor your use of
            the Service for transactions and activity that are impermissible or prohibited under the terms of this
            Agreement; provided, however, that Credit Union reserves the right to decline to execute any transaction or
            activity that Credit Union believes violates the terms of this Agreement. PAYMENTS TO PAYEES AND NON-BILLER
            PAYEES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES OR ITS TERRITORIES ARE PROHIBITED THROUGH THE SERVICE.</li>
          <li><b>Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance.</b>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>By providing the Service with names, contact information, and/or account information of Payees and
                Non-Biller Payees to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize the Service to follow the information
                provided by you to the Service for a payment to be made to a Payee or Non-Biller Payee (such as, but not
                limited to, Payee/Non-Biller Payee name, Payee/Non-Biller Payee contact information, Payee/Non-Biller
                Payee account number, and Scheduled Payment Date) (such information, “Payment Instructions”) that it
                receives through the payment system. In order to process payments more efficiently and effectively, the
                Service may edit or alter payment data or data formats in accordance with Payee/Non-Biller Payee
                directives.</li>
              <li>When any payment or other online service generates items to be charged to your Payment Account, you
                agree that the Service may debit your Payment Account without requiring your signature on the item and
                without prior notice to you.
              </li>
              <li>When the Service receives a Payment Instruction, you authorize the Service to debit your Payment Account
                and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to the Deliver By
                Date. </li>
              <li>You also authorize the Service to credit your Payment Account for payments returned to the Service by
                the United States Postal Service, Payee or Non-Biller Payee, or payments remitted to you on behalf of
                another authorized user of the Service. </li>
              <li>The Service will use its best efforts to make all your payments properly. However, the Service shall
                incur no liability if the Service is unable to complete any payments initiated by you because of the
                existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>If your Payment Account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction or the
                    transaction would exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account;</li>
                  <li>The payment processing center is not working properly and you know or, to the extent reasonably
                    practicable, have been advised by the Service about the malfunction before you execute the
                    transaction;</li>
                  <li>You have not provided the Service with the correct Payment Account information, or the correct name,
                    address, phone number, email address, or account information for the Payee or Non-Biller Payee;
                    and/or,</li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Circumstances beyond control of the Service (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, or
                      interference from an outside force) prevent the proper execution of the transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>Provided none of the foregoing exceptions are applicable and you have a consumer account, if the
                      Service causes an incorrect amount of funds to be removed from your Payment Account or causes funds

                      Instructions, the Service shall be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds to
                      your Payment Account, and for directing to the proper Payee any previously misdirected transactions,
                      and, if applicable, for any late payment related charges. </p>
                    <p>Provided none of the foregoing exceptions are applicable, and you have a business account,

          <li><b>Additional Provisions Applicable Only to Business Accounts.</b>
            <ol type="i">
              <li><b>Protecting Your Login Credentials.</b> You agree that the Credit Union may send notices and other
                communications to the current address shown in our records, whether or not that address includes a
                designation for delivery to the attention of any particular individual. You further agree that the Credit
                Union will not be responsible or liable to you in any way if information is intercepted by an unauthorized
                person, either in transit or at your place of business. You agree to: <b>(i) keep your user name and
                  password (“Login Credentials”) secure and strictly confidential; (ii) instruct each person to whom you
                  have authorized to have user Login Credentials that he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorized
                  person; and (iii) immediately notify us and select new Login Credentials if you believe your user Login
                  Credentials have become known to an unauthorized person.</b></li>
              <li><b>The Credit Union will have no liability to you for any unauthorized payment or transfer made using
                  your user Login Credentials before you have notified us of possible unauthorized use and the Credit
                  Union has had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice.</b> The Credit Union may suspend or cancel
                your Login Credentials without receiving such notice from you if we suspect that your user Login
                Credentials are being used in an unauthorized or fraudulent manner. The Credit Union will have no
                liability for such suspension or cancellation. </li>
              <li><b>Acknowledgement of Commercially Reasonable Security Procedures.</b>[1] By using Digital Banking, you
                acknowledge and agree that you have been provided with a disclosure of the security procedures for
                electronic banking transactions, and that said security procedures are commercially reasonable. You agree
                to be bound by instructions, whether authorized or unauthorized, which the Credit Union implements in
                compliance with these procedures, unless you have given the Credit Union prior notice of possible
                unauthorized use as described above (and we had a reasonable opportunity to act on such notice).</li>
              <li><b>Limitations of the Credit Union’s Liability.</b> If the Credit Union fails or delays in making a
                payment or transfer pursuant to your instructions, or if the Credit Union makes a payment or transfer in
                an erroneous amount that is less than the amount per your instructions, unless otherwise required by law,
                the Credit Union’s liability shall be limited to interest on the amount that the Credit Union failed to
                timely pay or transfer, calculated from the date on which the payment or transfer was to be made until the
                date it was actually made or you canceled the instructions. The Credit Union may pay such interest either
                to you or the intended recipient of the payment or transfer, but in no event will we be liable to both
                parties, and the Credit Union’s payment to either party will fully discharge any obligation to the other.
                If the Credit Union makes a payment or transfer in an erroneous amount that exceeds the amount per your
                instructions, or if the Credit Union permits an unauthorized payment or transfer after the Credit Union
                has had a reasonable time to act on a notice from you of possible unauthorized use as described above,
                unless otherwise required by law, the Credit Union’s liability will be limited to a refund of the amount
                erroneously paid or transferred, plus interest thereon from the date of the payment or transfer to the
                date of the refund, but in no event to exceed sixty (60) days' interest. If the Credit Union becomes
                liable to you for interest compensation under this Agreement or applicable law, such interest shall be
                calculated based on the average federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where the
                Credit Union is headquartered for each day interest is due, computed on the basis of a 360-day year.
                <b>Unless otherwise required by law, in no event will the Credit Union be liable to you for special,
                  indirect or consequential damages including, without limitation, lost profits or attorney's fees, even
                  if we are advised in advance of the possibility of such damages.</b>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Payment Methods.</b> The Service reserves the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your
            behalf to your Payee or Non-Biller Payee. These payment methods may include, but may not be limited to, an
            electronic payment, an electronic to check payment, or a laser draft payment.</li>
          <li><b>Payment Cancellation Requests.</b> You may cancel or edit any scheduled payment (including recurring
            payments) by following the directions within the Service. There is no charge for canceling or editing a
            scheduled payment. Once the Service has begun processing a payment it cannot be cancelled or edited, therefore
            a stop payment request must be submitted.</li>
          <li><b>Stop Payment Requests.</b> The Service's ability to process a stop payment request will depend on the
            payment method and whether or not a check has cleared. The Service may also not have a reasonable opportunity
            to act on any stop payment request after a payment has been processed. If you desire to stop any payment that
            has already been processed, you must contact the Credit Union at 303-321-4209 or 1-800-858-7212. You may also
            send us an email at Email@WesterraCU.com, send a secure message through Digital Banking, or utilize
            functionality within Digital Banking that allows you to submit a stop payment request. Although the Service
            will make every effort to accommodate your request, the Service will have no liability for failing to do so.
            The Service may also require you to present your request in writing within fourteen (14) days. The charge for
            each stop payment request will be the current charge for such service as set out in the Service Charge and Fee
            Schedule.</li>
          <li><b>Exception Payments.</b> Tax payments and court ordered payments may be scheduled through the Service,
            however such payments are discouraged and will be scheduled at your own risk. In no event shall the Service be
            liable for any claims or damages resulting from your scheduling of these types of payments. The Service has no
            obligation to research or resolve any claim resulting from an exception payment. All research and resolution
            for any misapplied, mis-posted or misdirected payments will be the sole responsibility of you and not of the
            Service.</li>
          <li><b>Bill Delivery and Presentment.</b> This feature is for the presentment of electronic bills only and it is
            your sole responsibility to contact your Payees directly if you do not receive your statements. In addition,
            if you elect to activate one of the Service's electronic bill options, you also agree to the following:
            <ol type="a">
              <li><b>Information Provided to the Payee.</b> The Service is unable to update or change your personal
                information such as, but not limited to, name, address, phone numbers and email addresses, with the
                electronic Payee. Any changes will need to be made by contacting the Payee directly. Additionally it is
                your responsibility to maintain all usernames and passwords for all electronic Payee sites. You also agree
                not to use someone else's information to gain unauthorized access to another person's bill. The Service
                may, at the request of the Payee, provide to the Payee your email address, service address, or other data
                specifically requested by the Payee at the time of activating the electronic bill for that Payee, for
                purposes of the Payee informing you about bill information.</li>
              <li><b>Activation.</b> Upon activation of the electronic bill feature the Service may notify the Payee of
                your request to receive electronic billing information. The presentment of your first electronic bill may
                vary from Payee to Payee and may take up to sixty (60) days, depending on the billing cycle of each Payee.
                Additionally, the ability to receive a paper copy of your statement(s) is at the sole discretion of the
                Payee. While your electronic bill feature is being activated it is your responsibility to keep your
                accounts current. Each electronic Payee reserves the right to accept or deny your request to receive
                electronic bills.
              </li>
              <li><b>Authorization to Obtain Bill Data.</b> Your activation of the electronic bill feature for a Payee
                shall be deemed by the Credit Union to be your authorization for the Credit Union to obtain bill data from
                the Payee on your behalf. For some Payees, you will be asked to input your username and password for that
                payee's online account. By providing the Credit Union with such information, you authorize the Credit
                Union to use the information to obtain your bill data.</li>
              <li><b>Notification.</b> The Service will use its best efforts to present all of your electronic bills
                promptly. In addition to notification within the Service, the Service may send an email notification to
                the email address listed for your account. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that this information
                is accurate. In the event you do not receive notification, it is your responsibility to periodically logon
                to the Service and check on the delivery of new electronic bills. The time for notification may vary from
                Payee to Payee. You are responsible for ensuring timely payment of all bills.</li>
              <li><b>Cancellation of Electronic Bill Notification.</b> The electronic Payee reserves the right to cancel
                the presentment of electronic bills at any time. You may cancel electronic bill presentment at any time.
                The timeframe for cancellation of your electronic bill presentment may vary from Payee to Payee. It may
                take up to sixty (60) days, depending on the billing cycle of each Payee. The Service will notify your
                electronic Payee(s) as to the change in status of your account and it is your sole responsibility to make
                arrangements for an alternative form of bill delivery. The Service will not be responsible for presenting
                any electronic bills that are already in process at the time of cancellation.</li>
              <li><b>Non-Delivery of Electronic Bill(s).</b> You agree to hold the Service harmless should the Payee fail
                to deliver your statement(s). You are responsible for ensuring timely payment of all bills. Copies of
                previously delivered bills must be requested from the Payee directly.</li>
              <li><b>Liability to Payees.</b> This Agreement does not alter your liability or obligations that currently
                exist between you and your Payees.</li>

            parties about your account or the transactions you make ONLY in the following situations:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Where it is necessary for completing transactions;</li>
              <li>Where it is necessary for activating additional services; </li>

          <li><b>Service Fees and Additional Charges.</b> Any applicable fees will be charged regardless of whether the
            Service was used during the billing cycle. There may be a charge for additional transactions and other
            optional services. All such fees are detailed on our Service Charge and Fee Schedule. You agree to pay such
            charges and authorize the Service to deduct the calculated amount from your designated Payment Account for
            these amounts and any additional charges that may be incurred by you. Any financial fees associated with your
            standard deposit accounts will continue to apply. You are responsible for any and all telephone access fees
            and/or Internet service fees that may be assessed by your telephone and/or Internet service provider.</li>
          <li>Failed or Returned Transactions. In using the Service, you are requesting the Service to make payments for
            you from your Payment Account. If we are unable to complete the transaction for any reason associated with
            your Payment Account (for example, there are insufficient funds in your Payment Account to cover the
            transaction), the transaction will not be completed. Current fees are listed on the Service Charge and Fee
            Schedule located on the Resources – Disclosures & Agreements section of the Westerra Credit Union website
            (https://Westerracu.com). In some instances, you will receive a return notice from the Service. In such case,

            refuse to pay a Payee or Non-Biller Payee designated by you. This notification is not required if you attempt
            to make a prohibited payment or an exception payment under this Agreement.</li>
          <li><b>Returned Payments.</b> In using the Service, you understand that Payees/Non-Biller Payees and/or the

          <li><b>Information Authorization.</b> Your enrollment in the Service may not be fulfilled if the Service cannot

            offsetting debits and credits to your accounts used for external transfers within the Service, and require
            confirmation of such from you in order to verify ownership of your Payment Account(s). You agree that the
            Service reserves the right to obtain financial information regarding your account from a Payee or the Credit
            Union (for example, to resolve payment posting problems or for verification).</li>
          <li><b>Term and Termination.</b> Your Service will become effective on the date that you enroll an account for

                notice and with or without cause, including, without limitation, in the event that you violate this
                Agreement or close your Payment Account. If more than one person can access a Service, the Credit Union
                reserves the absolute right to terminate all access to the Services upon the request of the account owner,
                any account co-owner, or any other person authorized to access the account. To terminate the Service, you

                discontinue use of the Service, and the termination date of the Service. When the Service is terminated,
                any prescheduled bill payment will also be terminated. Your final charge for the Service will be assessed

          without liability to you. We are not responsible for items we do not receive or for images that are lost in

            this Alerts Terms of Use does not apply. To the extent there is any conflict between the terms of the

          <p><i>Alerts.</i> Your enrollment in Westerra Credit Union Online Banking and/or Mobile Banking (the “Service”)
            includes enrollment to receive transaction alerts and notifications (“Alerts”). Alerts are electronic notices
            from us that contain transactional information about your Westerra Credit Union account(s). Alerts are
            provided within the following categories: </p>
          <ul class="ml-5" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Mandatory Alerts provide you with important account notifications, such as information about changes to
              your Digital Banking password, username, or login information. You do not have the option to suppress these
              Mandatory Alerts. </li>
            <li>Account Alerts provide you with notification of important account activities or when certain changes are
              made to your Service accounts. These Alerts are automatically activated for you. Although you may suppress
              these Account Alerts, we strongly recommend that you do not do so because they provide important information
              related to your Service accounts. </li>
            <li>Additional Alerts must be activated by you to be enabled. These Additional Alerts can be accessed from the
              More menu within Westerra Credit Union Mobile Banking. Account Alerts and Additional Alerts must be managed
              and/or added online through the Service. You cannot maintain all Alerts through your mobile device. We may
              add new Alerts from time to time, or cancel old Alerts. We usually notify you when we cancel Alerts, but are
              not obligated to do so. Westerra Credit Union reserves the right to terminate its Alerts service at any time
              without prior notice to you. </li>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="">
        <p class=""><i>Methods of Delivery.</i> We may provide Alerts through one or more channels (“EndPoints”): (a) a
          mobile device, by text message; (b) a mobile device, by push notification; (c) an email account, by an email
          message; or (d) your Westerra Credit Union Digital Banking message inbox, by an email message. You agree to
          receive Alerts through these EndPoints, and it is your responsibility to determine that each of the service
          providers for the EndPoints described in (a) through (c) above supports the email, push notification, and text
          message Alerts provided through the Alerts service. Please be advised that text or data charges or rates may be
          imposed by your EndPoint service provider. Alert frequency varies by account and preferences. You agree to
          provide us a valid mobile phone number or email address so that we may send you Alerts. If your email address or
          your mobile device’s number changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change. Your Alerts will be
          updated to reflect the changes that you communicate to us with regard to your primary and secondary email
          addresses or mobile device number. </p>
        <p class=""><i>Alerts via Text Message.</i> To stop Alerts via text message, log in to Digital Banking, select
          Manage Notifications, choose the account and alert you wish to disable notifications for, and uncheck the SMS
          option. Alerts sent to your primary email address will be unaffected by this action. To restore Alerts on your

        <p class=""><i>Limitations.</i> Westerra Credit Union provides Alerts as a convenience to you for information
          purposes only. An Alert does not constitute a bank record for the deposit or credit account to which it
          pertains. We strive to provide Alerts in a timely manner with accurate information. However, you acknowledge and
          agree that your receipt of any Alerts may be delayed or prevented by factor(s) affecting your mobile phone
          service provider, internet service provider(s) and other factors outside Westerra Credit Union’s control. We
          neither guarantee the delivery nor the accuracy of the contents of each Alert. You agree to not hold Westerra
          Credit Union, its directors, officers, employees, agents and service providers liable for losses or damages,
          including attorneys’ fees, that may arise, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from (a) a non-delivery,
          delayed delivery, or the misdirected delivery of an Alert; (b) inaccurate or incomplete content in an Alert; or
          (c) your reliance on or use of the information provided in an Alert for any purpose. </p>
        <p class=""><i>Alert Information.</i> As Alerts delivered via SMS, email and push notifications are not encrypted,
          we will never include your passcode or full account number. You acknowledge and agree that Alerts may not be
          encrypted and may include your name and some information about your accounts, and anyone with access to your

          of Mobile Banking, Westerra Credit Union and its affiliates and service providers, may receive data about your
          usage of the service (such as session length, number of transactions and geolocation), and other data and

          Credit Union and its affiliates and service providers will maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the
          information from unauthorized disclosure or use, but reserve the right to use and disclose this information as
          reasonably necessary to deliver Mobile Banking, perform analytics to improve the service, and as otherwise
          permitted by law, including compliance with court orders or lawful instructions from a government agency, to
          protect the personal safety of subscribers or the public, to defend claims, and as otherwise authorized by you.
